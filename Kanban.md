### Definitions

Kanban (看板) (signboard or billboard in Japanese) is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing and just-in-time manufacturing (JIT).
[[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)]

### Key Concept: Just-In-Time

- Supermarkets don't order a large quantity of one particular product
- They tend to order smaller amounts and then re-order ""just-in-time" when stocks are low
- This form of scheduling system keeps the right amount of products on the shelves at any given time

### Emergence of Kanban: Toyota 

- Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency
- Toyota engineers applied a visual management system by using actual cards on a bulletin board to show the steps in their manufacturing process

### 6 Key Elements of Kanban

1. Limit Work In Progress:  Focus on starting, finishing, and releasing a smaller number of features
2. Manage Flow: Flow is the concept of moving items quickly through the system
3. Feedback Loops: Consider improvements and reflect on the specifics
4. Improve/Evolve: Run experiments and try to improve
5. Visualize: Use a highly visual status board which shows all of the status, bottlenecks, and system limits
6. Explicit Policies: Monitor policies like `Definition of Done` to track the deliverables

### Kanban Board

- A visual systym containing columns that represent the status of an item/task
- A typical set of column/status contains:
  1. "To Do"
  2. "In Progress"
  3. "Test"
  4. "Done"
- Each column will have limits, as in the highest number of items/tasks that one column/status can hold at a time - this limits Work In Progress items, one of the key elements of Kanban
